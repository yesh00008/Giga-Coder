## Running the repo

To run the repo locally, simply `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run dev` to run the app.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add self-correcting to the app so it can fix its own errors
- [ ] Compressing prompt: Use efficient models to retain conversation history, good memory management is key
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics to measure system performance over time and when making new changes
- [ ] Add more good examples to the shadcn-examples.ts file (single components that span a whole app and use shadcn)
- [ ] Add dynamic OG images to the specific generations & include the prompt + a screenshot in the image
- [ ] Show a "featured apps" section on /gallery (or have some at the bottom of the homepage as templates). Have a /id/${prompt} dynamic route that can display a bunch of nice example apps in the sandbox ready to go
- [ ] Try finetuning a smaller model on good prompts from deepseek-v2 or o1/Claude
- [ ] Add dark mode to the site overall, nice design change
- [ ] Support more languages starting with Python (like streamlit) and see if I can run them on CSB SDK
